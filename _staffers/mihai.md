Hi everyone! My name is Mihai Tudor. I am a 3rd Year EECS major primarily interested in hardware and computer architecture, so absolutely feel free to reach out if you're interested in those spaces! In my free time, I love dancing (Come to AFX showcase yay), learning guitar (I am a complete beginner), and slogging my way through one piece (I cannot sit still for longer than two episodes holy heck). Super excited to get to know you all and I hope you enjoy this class as much as I did!
